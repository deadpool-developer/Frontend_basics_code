//javascript is dynamically tight which means we do not have to define the type of the variable
function test(){
    var a = 1    //Number
    var b = 1.020 //Floating Number
    var c = "ABC"  //String
    var d = 'A'   //Character
    var e = `I am a multi-line string and closed in back ticks` //Multiline string
    var f = [1,2,3,4,5] //Array
    var g = ["aa","bb","cc"]  //String as an array
    var h = [{name: "Aditya" , age:21}]  //Objects
    //In javascript most of the thing is object.
    //OBJECT: key:value pair is an object
