console.log(2 < '3') //as javascript is very dynamic in nature, it check if there is a string it convert it to a number and then compute it

console.log(2 < '2')

console.log('2' > '12')

console.log('2' < '12')

console.log(2 == '2')

//This triple equals(===) means that first check the type of both the operands and then compute them
console.log(2 === '2')
console.log(typeof 2 == typeof '2' && 2 == '2') //meaning of above line

console.log( 3 !== 4) //type check of not equal to is done like this
